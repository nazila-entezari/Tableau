In this Analysis we have picked a sample of more than 12 million records in two datasets for months of January to August  2019 and 2020. We have selected only most popular stations ( by the number of rides) for our analysis. The total distance from that station is another measure we have to mark out the importance of our station.
The popularity map has evolved from 2019 into 2020. 
Also the number of rides and distance of ridership has decreased.
The reason might be related to the COVID19 Pandemic. we will dig more into this with more analysis.

A basic comparison of the nember of Rides in 2020 relative to the same period of 2019 shows a dramatic drop around spring season. The number of Rides has obviously decreased and the seasonal summer growth is not as expected for 2020, but for us to know how the revenue has changed we need to look at the subscriber customer breakdown.

As anticipated the number of Subscribers outnumbers the seasonal customers. The seasonal customers over the course of 2020 like 2019 has always inclined, whereas the number of subscribers in 2020 has a dramatic drop around spring time. Generally The number of Subscribers in 2020 is much lower than 2019. Having the fees for both types we could calculate the revenue decrease in 2020 according to COVID-19 situation.

Most Riders in the popular areas of CITIBIKE service in NewYork are around 29 years old which corresponds to the median age group of the study area. There is a trend in the gender share as we move into 2020 and that is the shrinking share of male riders vs female as shown in the pie charts. it could be the female outreach growth over time.

There are certain bike ids which have been used much more than others. As a measure of usage, we take in the total distance each bike has had. 
There might be a need for inspection or repair corresponding to the distance each bike ID has already been ridden. we have created an interactive tool to choose the bikes which are more probably going to need an inspection.
